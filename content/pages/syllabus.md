Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

This course is an introduction to quantum computational complexity theory, the study of the fundamental capabilities and limitations of quantum computers. Topics include complexity classes, lower bounds, communication complexity, proofs, advice, and interactive proof systems in the quantum world. The objective is to bring students to the research frontier.

Requirements
------------

Projects
--------

All students are expected to complete a course project. This will involve submitting a written report, as well as giving a 10-minute presentation toward the end of class. The projects can be either original research or literature surveys on some topic in quantum complexity theory (or related areas of quantum information science). Survey projects should be individual, while research projects can be done either individually or in teams of two. Many possibilities for projects will be discussed as the course progresses. Solving a significant open problem pretty much guarantees an A in the course.

Problem Sets
------------

There will be 4-5 problem sets. Problem sets will be due about two weeks after being assigned. Students are welcome to collaborate on problem sets; however, if they do so, they must list the names of collaborators.

Scribe Notes
------------

Notes (taken by the students) from a previous offering of the course are available in the {{% resource_link 0ae74169-1168-dcc5-4644-05254b3e4264 "Lecture Notes" %}} section. We will not follow the 2008 notes exactly this semester, but will follow them for perhaps 70-80% of the course. Since no book exists that covers much of the material, the notes should be an extremely useful resource. However, please be warned that the notes haven't been carefully proofread and contain some errors and omissions.

Textbooks
---------

The course has no official textbook. However, students may find the following books helpful:

Nielsen, Michael, and Issac Chuang. _Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_. Cambridge University Press, 2011. ISBN: 9781107002173.

Mermin, David. _Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction_. Cambridge University Press, 2007. ISBN: 9780521876582.

Arora, Sanjeev, and Boaz Barak. [_Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach_](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/). Cambridge University Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780521424264.

Prerequisites
-------------

No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is assumed. Open to students who have taken a previous course on computational complexity theory (such as [6.045](/courses/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011) or [6.840](/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2006)), or a previous course on quantum computing and information (such as [18.435](/courses/18-435j-quantum-computation-fall-2003)).
